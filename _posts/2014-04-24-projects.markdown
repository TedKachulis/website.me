### NavU (Mobile Application)
<body>This project is an offline application for android based systems that helps students navigate their way through confusing university campuses. The app provides two dimensional floor plans of buildings at Carleton University along with features such as navigational mapping, search functionality, personalised class schedules, and a notification system. </body>

<body>
In the demo code of our application found online above, there are limited buildings mapped. This was just to demonstrate functionality for our course at school, COMP3004: Software Engineering Design. <br><br>

### Network Domain Analysis Software (Java Application)
<body>This project is an offline application prepared by myself and Michael Stupich for Windows based systems, that provides a platform for testing network signal coverage efficiencies. <br><br>Download the .jar file from our repository below, and try it yourself! If you'd rather not, but would like to see examples of it's functionality and testing results, read our analytical report on network domain coverage efficiency, linked below. We used our software only to complete this analysis.</body>
